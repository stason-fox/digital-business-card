# Digital Business Card

#### Description: Digital business card. Tools used: React, CSS, HTML.

I designed a digital business card for myself using React. This is my first React project and I am very happy with it. It has taught me a lot about creating apps with React and it has also improved my CSS skills as well. I like how organized React is. Being able to separate code into components makes everything easier to manage. This project as been good practice and I'm looking forward to my next React project.
